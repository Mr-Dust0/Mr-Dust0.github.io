FAT (file allocation table)
The file allocation table (FAT) file system was originally developed in 1977 for use on floppy disks and the windows 9x operating systems. However,

      MFT
General
A feature of NTFS that sets it apart from other file systems is that the entire file system is considered data area which
means that any sector can be allocated to a file.The only layout an NTFS file system has is that the first sectors of the volume
contain the boot sector and the boot code.

The master file table is the main feature of the NTFS file system because it co...

      Hash extension

This attack allows an attacker to append arbitrary data to the text being hashed (with sha1, sha2 and md5) as long as the users data is at the end 
and know a valid hash. This can allow to an attacker to create a valid hash with malicious data even if a secret is prepended to
the data being hashed.

Background on hashes

This was an easy  box that featured an unprotected git repository that we could use to see that it is using vulnerable
software that we can use to read a sensitive file containing a password and then ssh into the box. Then we see that root 
is running a custom script that was executing a vulnerable version of binwalk that we could use to get a shell as root.
